# Introduction

Check out this OpenAI blog post for an intro to Domain Randomization:
https://blog.openai.com/spam-detection-in-the-physical-world/

I followed the details in this paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06907.pdf

There was some nice stuff in OpenAI's [mujoco_py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py) repo to make this easier


## Demo
This shows an initial demo of the randomization of the competition arena.  

The top image shows our robot in the 2017 competition, being teleopped through 
the obstacle field.  The purpose of this project is to detect the rocks so 
that we can autonomously path plan around them.

The other 4 images show simulation renderings, generated by Mujoco from the 
robot's POV, with randomized textures, arena walls, and rock shapes. (the rocks 
have since been randomly generated using Blender to create more realistic and 
unique meshes to train on. I am also working on creating meshes to make the 
ground more irregular, as well as adding more distractor objects to 
the world).

# Installation

## Install `mujoco_py`

This was a huge headache and I had to do some hacky stuff to get it to work on 
my Ubuntu desktop.  Mac was really easy to get it working and I would guess putting 
it in the cloud is not bad, because I'm pretty sure that's the way the folks at 
OpenAI are doing it.

To get it to work, I cloned the repo, modified some source files, ran sudo python3 setup.py install in the folder and it somewhat worked.
```
git clone https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py.git

cd mujoco_py

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

sudo python3 setup.py install 
```

Then, there will be many errors to fix, but most several are fixed by apt-get getting
or pip installing something.

After that, I was still getting some errors, like [this](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/issues/44).
I had to do some hacky stuff and I am not using GPU rendering, but it is running.
If you have any issues, feel free to reach out to me.  



## Install `blender`

```
sudo apt-get install blender
```

Test it with 
```
blender
```

### If you are running on your local desktop (w/ monitor):

Use the file in `assets/add_mesh_rock.zip` and follow:
https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/8746/how-can-i-make-unique-rocks-in-blender-without-having-to-model-them-by-hand

Then activate it by clicking the check mark

### [untested] Alternatively, if you are running headless (in cloud):
```
cp /path/to/rock_detector/assets/add_mesh_rocks.zip ~/.config/blender/<VERSION>/scripts/addons/

cd ~/.config/blender/<VERSION>/scripts/addons
unzip add_mesh_rocks.zip
```

# Mujoco Tips

- More documentation on lighting can be found here: http://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter05.html#name10
- You need to call sim.step() to get the camera and light modders to update
- You can't scale a mesh after it has been loaded (http://www.mujoco.org/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-scale-already-exist-model.3483/)
- Read this: https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/issues/148 and this: https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/234
- To make it so cameras don't look through walls, you need to add:

```

    <map znear=0.01 /> 
  </visual>
```
